console.log("Hello from Javascript"); // This is the way to print text in console
// This is how a comment is made in js 
// Or you can create large comments by:
/*
muchas cosas 
*/

/* Data types:
 undefined; could take any variable type later 
 null; nothing inside
 boolean; True or False
 symbol; 
 number; just number
 object; you can add atributtes and stuff
 */
// To declare a variable you need to do like these 3 examples:
var myName = "Marco"; //This one is ised for the entire program 
myNumber = 8;
let ourName = "Marco";// Just in the current scope 
const pi = 3.14159;  // Its just a constant, never change

/* A basic note: 
Every single line of code ends with ; */
// You can asign and declare a variable in the same line 
var a = 7;

// Basic operators 
var sum = 10 + 23;
var difference = 45 - 25;
var product = 8 * 2;
var quotient = 66/2;
// You can increment variables, this :
var myVar = 87;
myVar = myVar + 1 
// is the same as:
myVar++;
// or decrease the number 
myVar--;
// The % operator does the same as python, returns a bolean 
//Also, you can sum, rest, multiply or divide the same var like this:
var a = 3;
a += 12; // This is the same as a = a + 12
// All the sring are between "" or '' the same as python 
/* If you need to put a quotation mark inside a string, you can do it like this: */
var myString = "The operators says \"Hello people\""; //Or just use the single quotes
/* The \n \t and \n works the same as python */
/* You can concat string with +, and also add to itself as a operator*/
var ourString = "I come first" + "I come second";
ourString += "Word added";
